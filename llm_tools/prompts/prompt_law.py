TASK:
Your goal is to generate a plausible textual explanation or narrative explaining why the law school application was denied for this student.

PERSONALIZATION INSTRUCTION:
Based on the provided PERSONAL INFORMATION about the student, create a personalized narrative tailored to them. 
The narrative should feel like it was written specifically for this individual, acknowledging their personal circumstances and creating a more personalized experience. 
However, do not force the personalization: it should be seamlessly integrated into the narrative.

Write a detailed narrative explanation tailored to this non-technical reader that MUST explain:
1) The current situation of the applicant (what are their features and background).
2) The model's predicted probability of bar exam failure and what this means for the student.
3) Why the application was denied: which features were most important in driving this prediction and why (focus on the ranking of most important features).
4) How each of the top {num_features} most important features contributed (either pushing toward bar exam failure or toward passing).
5) What the applicant should do next

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT invent new SHAP values or new numerical values.
- Do not use the numeric SHAP values in your answer. Instead, discuss the ranking and direction of influence.
- Do not talk about model internals, algorithms, or training details.
- Do not include greeting or closing statements.

STYLE:
- Length: 12-15 sentences.
- Write a coherent narrative without bullet points or tables. 
- Directly address the student and provide PERSONALIZED insights tailored to THEIR situation (you can use the personal information provided), but let it sound natural. 
- Do NOT copy-paste feature names, but instead incorporate them naturally in the narrative.
- Include feature values and their comparisons to averages or distributions, but reserve this for features where it really clarifies the explanation.
